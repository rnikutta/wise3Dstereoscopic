This stereoscopic plot (cross your eyes!) shows the distribution of
different types of astronomical objects in the 3D color space of the
WISE spacecraft (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer). Several classes
of objects are identified with differently colored dots. In
traditional 2D color-color plots clusters can overlap, making it
difficult to identify them. A 3D color-color plot, and especially a
stereoscopic view of it, provides a much more intuitive and immersive
experience.

Carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (AGB) are shown in
blue. Most of them are found in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. Oxygen-rich AGB stars are shown in red. Young Stellar Objects
(YSO) which are surrounded by dusty shells with constant radial
density profiles and small optical depths are shown in green. Both
cool (~600 Kelvin) and warm (~1200 Kelvin) shells fall in this
region. Warmer YSO shells of constant density fall in the the cluster
of orange color, but their optical depths are also higher. Finally,
small black dots show other astronomical objects in our Galaxy and its
satellites which have not been associated with the other
clusters. They are typically a mix of everything.
